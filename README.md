# Spatio-temporal-Navigation-Map-based-on-Prediction
This code is for the work of 《Trajectory Prediction-based Local Spatio-temporal Navigation Map for Autonomous Driving in Dynamic Highway Environment》.
In this work, we construct a framework of **LSTM(Long-short Term Memory)+MDN** to predict the possible future trajectories of surrounding vehicles in 3s. Then, the prediction results are projected into the coordinate system whose origin is from the perspective of the ego vehicle, and a 3D spatio-temporal map is constructed. Through the spatio-temporal map, the dynamic obstacles around the ego vehicle are transformed into static obstacles extending along the time axis, thus the dynamic obstacle avoidance problem is tranlated into static obstacle avoidance problem, assisting the ego vehicle in decision-making and local path planning.
